#### Features

#### How to use

#### About compiler
- The compiler itself is a one-pass compiler. It follows Niklaus Wirthâ€™s design, completely skips AST generation and generates binary directly.
- Due to the lack of AST, only constant folding and peephole optimizations are implemented.
- The performance of its virtual machine should be better than CPython.
